## Hi there, I'm Lucas 👋

I'm a third-year Computer Science student at the **University of Victoria**, specializing in **Software Systems Development** and **Networks**.  

I also have a personal interest in **cybersecurity**, which I am pursuing outside of my academic studies.

### 🌐 Current Focus
Most of my time is dedicated to coursework, but outside of school, I’m actively developing my personal website.  

The site serves as both a **portfolio and a sandbox project**, where I’ve been exploring and building interesting features.

Through this project, I’ve gained hands-on experience with **PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, and CSS**, along with **security practices** (input validation, email verification, Cloudflare protections) and **server administration** on a self-hosted machine.
